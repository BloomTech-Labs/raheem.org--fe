### Description 
Raheem is an independent online service that helps people take action against police violence. We're a startup non-profit, based in Oakland, CA with the mission of bringing the voices of people impacted by police violence into the conversation to end it; holding individual officers accountable; and building policy based on community experience. 


### Key Features

-    Give people who have experienced police violence a reason to tell their story and make it easy for them to do so.
-   Showcase those stories for other community members, media, activists, and policymakers.

## Tech Stack

### Front end built using:

#### React.js, Context API, styled-components, Material-UI, react-router-dom, react-hook-form 

Why did you choose this framework?

-    React.js provided us with a familiar framework to develop a lightweight, client-side routed application for our stakeholder.
-   With little need for an extensive global state management system, React's built in Context API allowed us to manage our form state accross the application.
- styled-components provided us the flexibility of styling with vanilla CSS, with the added power of styled-components to design our application directly in line with the UX team's vision. Material-UI was used for some more advanced components such as the rating slider on the Report page.
- react-router-dom provided us great client-side routing to develop a fast, responsive application.
- react-hook-form provided great form building and validation.

#### Front end deployed to AWS Amplify
